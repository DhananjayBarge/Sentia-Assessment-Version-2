# Sentia-Assessment-Version-2
This is the version 2 arch desgin and ARM code module for the assessment.
I have added the working example of the sftp from storage account. Details to access the SFTP has been added to the presentation document slide.
ARM codes are created for the deployment from both the designs specially Mongo DB replicaset VM and COSMOS DB api for MongoDB. Remianing code for Frondoor with App service and storage SFTP is same for both the designs.
